## My process
I started with HTML then CSS.

I used css grid to align before styling.

finally after the styling comes the finishing touches, which takes time!!

I did desktop design before mobile.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid




### What I learned

I learned how to use css grid grid area, I am getting better at responsive designs.


```css
 {
  
  grid-template-areas:
    "daniel daniel jonathan kira"
    "jeannette patrick patrick kira";
}

```



### Continued development


I need wasnt able to fixed the quotation marks to its parent element and push it behind the p element.
i tried using margin but it makes the div contents it is not resposive. i settles with margin. 4hrs of hw same thing.
 chrome and firefox windows zoom is different with my design being perfect in firefoz and bad in chrome.!


I definetly need to practice using css grid more and css flexbox. I need work on responsive design and accessibilty too.
